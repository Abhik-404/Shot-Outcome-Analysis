# The Anatomy of a Goal

📌 **Overview**
This project dives deep into the art and science of **goal-scoring in football** by analyzing **941,000+ event-level records** across **Europe’s Top 5 Leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy, France)** between **2011–2017**.

Using a blend of **exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and predictive analytics**, the study uncovers how **shot characteristics, assist methods, match situations, and player attributes** influence goal conversion rates.

Beyond describing patterns, the project builds a **logistic regression model** to predict the likelihood of a goal — offering valuable insights for analysts, coaches, and clubs aiming to optimize attacking strategies.

📊 **Key Analyses**

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Shot distributions by location, body part, assist type, and match situation.
* **Bivariate & Multivariate Insights:** Interaction effects (e.g., location × body part, assist × situation).
* **Player Analysis:** Elite finishers like Messi, Ronaldo, Lewandowski, Cavani & Ibrahimović, compared by conversion efficiency.
* **Team Analysis:** Club-wise efficiency — Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG, and Bayern leading in ruthless finishing.
* **Predictive Modeling:**

  * Logistic Regression on goal probability.
  * Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and AUC evaluation.
* **Model Performance:** 91.3% accuracy, specificity of 99.1%, sensitivity of 19.9%, and ROC AUC of 0.80.

🔍 **Key Insights**

* **Golden Zones:** Shots from the penalty spot & six-yard box boast >70% conversion.
* **Set Pieces:** Highly effective when combined with right-footed finishing.
* **Through Balls:** The most lethal assist method, outperforming crosses and simple passes.
* **Player Profiles:** Messi thrives in open play, Ronaldo & Ibrahimović dominate aerially, Lewandowski & Cavani shine in set pieces, and Aubameyang/Griezmann excel with pace and through balls.
* **Team Patterns:** Barcelona and Real Madrid lead in efficiency, while English giants lag comparatively.

📈 **Future Work**

* Extend predictors to include contextual features (team form, league position, opposition strength).
* Apply **Difference-in-Differences** or **Synthetic Control** for causal evaluation of tactical changes.
* Explore **Survival Analysis** of attacking moves (from build-up to goal).
* Experiment with **advanced ML models** (Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) for non-linear goal prediction.

🛠️ **Tech Stack**

* **Language:** R
* **Libraries:** ggplot2, dplyr, caret, ROCR, stats, glm
* **Data Source:** Event-level football data covering Europe’s Top 5 leagues (2011–2017).

Would you like me to also create a **short “Features” section** (bullet points about repo contents: scripts, data processing, plots, models) so recruiters/visitors know exactly what’s inside at a glance?
